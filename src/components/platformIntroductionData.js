    {
      title: "Core Objectives",
      content:
        "The primary goal of platform engineering is to reduce complexity for software developers. It achieves this by abstracting the underlying infrastructure and providing a suite of tools and services that automate many aspects of development, testing, deployment, and scaling. This not only speeds up the development process but also ensures consistency and reliability across different environments.",

      title: "Key Components",
      content:
        "A typical platform engineering ecosystem includes container orchestration systems like Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines, monitoring tools, and infrastructure as code (IaC) solutions. These components work together to provide a seamless, automated workflow that supports cloud-native application development.",

      title: "Modern Relevance",
      content:
        "In today's fast-paced, cloud-centric world, platform engineering plays a crucial role in helping organizations achieve digital transformation. It allows businesses to be more agile, enabling rapid adaptation to market changes and user demands with minimal disruption.",
