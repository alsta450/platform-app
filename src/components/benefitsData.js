      "Platform engineering streamlines the development process by reducing the complexity that developers face when setting up and configuring environments. Tools and platforms automate repetitive tasks such as provisioning, deployments, and scaling operations. This automation frees developers to focus on writing code and innovating, rather than managing infrastructure, thereby accelerating the development cycles.",
